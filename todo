Accidentals in the source file need to be handled intelligently.  This 
has escaped detection presumably because GHB scores almost never have 
accidentals.  The only scores I'm aware of that include them are by 
Gordon Duncan, particularly his arrangement of AC/DC's "Thunderstruck".  
In that tune, three natural Fs appear.
